            Staple makes a special sourdough flatbread name Injera.
            This is ideally made from the native Ethiopian grain Teff.
            Various sauces called Wot are served for this purpose,
            which are available in different various vegetarian and meat versions.
            The rule is: whoever can afford, eats meat, among other things, lamb is popular.
            Pork, on the other hand, is only eaten by missionary Christians because Islam and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church outlaw its consumption.
            Eaten with the right hand. The Injera replaces the cutlery and represents the garnish, or the bread.
            You simply tear off small parts of the pita, grab a piece of the meat or vegetable preparations and bring it to your mouth.
            As a particularly friendly it is to put the part of the participating part directly to the mouth (Gursha).
            Generally, the Ethiopian food is very spicy, mostly by the spice.

            Ethiopia is a highly religious country with the majority of people either Orthodox Christian or Muslim.
            Those who follow Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity are prohibited from eating eating all animal products during
            the fasting for over 200 days out of the year. This includes during lent, religious holidays and every Wednesday and Friday except those following Easter.
            That makes many Orthodox Ethiopians vegan for more than half the year. Typical fasting dishes include injera,
            mild and spicy stews (wot) made with oil instead of ethiopian butter and variations of whole and powdered lentils, split peas, chick peas, sunflowers, and broad beans.
            Vegetables include various preparations of beets, Kale, cabbage, potato, and fresh tomatoes.
