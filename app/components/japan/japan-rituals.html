            In Japan, there are a lot of different rituals or common behaviour that are very specific to this country,
            especially when eating a meal. Not only during a meal, but before and after eating, there are certain phrases
            to say.<br>
            Especially in a japanese restaurant, there are many services that are common sense in Japan, but they would be
            unusual in another country.

        <text-card>
            Before you start to eat in Japan, you usually place your hands on your lap and say 'Itadakimasu' just before
            beginning. It has an equal meaning to 'Thank you for the food', 'Let us eat' or 'Buon appetit' in other
            languages.<br>
            The original meaning of the word is something like 'I humbly accept'. Saying it just before eating would
            actually mean something like accepting the food, but you may sometimes hear the word in another context.<br>
            Waiting for everyone to get ready before starting to eat would be polite, unless they say otherwise.

        <text-card>
            Just like saying 'Itadakimasu' before eating, after you finished, you say 'Gochisousama deshita', meaning
            something around 'Thank you for the good food' or 'It was delicious'. There are different variations of saying
            it, but this is the most common and most polite one. It shows appretiation to the person who cooked the meal.<br>
            You can also say the phrase when to the staff when leaving a restaurant to show them that you enjoyed the food.<br>

        <text-card>
            When you enter a japanese restaurant, they might offer you a small, wet and rolled-up towel.<br>
            Its temperature depends on the weather outside, when it is summer, they are cold and during winter, they are warm.<br>
            The service is there so you can wipe your hands before eating or to cool/warm your head.

            Without having to order it, the staff will automatically place a cold glass of water for everyone on the table
            for free.<br>
            But it is not only that, because after you have finished your meal, sometimes they offer you a free cup of warm
            green tea.<br>
            In Japan, you often do not need to order a drink. Though of course, you can order more anytime if you are feeling
            thirsty.

            In Japan, there is no meal that is more important than the others - breakfast, lunch and dinner are all equally
            important.<br>
            Every meal usually comes with rice. There is often grilled fish, miso soup and other warm food - even during
            breakfast. Warm green tea is also often part of a meal.<br>
            If you are underway or do not have much time, for example during work or school, you may eat a lunchbox
            (<a ui-sref="japan-food({'#': 'bento'})" style="display: contents">bento</a>).
