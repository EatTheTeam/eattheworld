            The japanese cuisine has a long and varied history, though because of its geographic location and climate,
            within the ingredients of japanese food, fish and rice have always been a part of it. For spices, soy sauce
            is usually used instead of salt or pepper.<br>
            Japanese meals are usually made out of a lot of small dishes that are eaten together.

                Sushi is probably the most known traditional food in Japan. It is a variety of dishes that all contain
                mostly of raw fish and rice, usually mixed with ingredients like seaweed or vegetables. In history, putting
                the raw fish on top of rice was a means to preserve the fish and prevent it from spoiling. At some point,
                the Japanese began to eat the rice together with the fish and make a variety of different meals with
                it.

            <image-card title="Sashimi (刺し身)"><p>
                Sashimi is a special kind of sushi that is not served together with rice. Since it is just raw fish, it
                has to be very fresh. When served, the meat is sliced into extremely thin slices and often eaten with soy
                sauce.

            <image-card title="Maki (巻き寿司)"><p>
                Maki are a type of rolled sushi. There are many types like Futomaki, Hosomaki, Ehōmaki or Temaki, but in
                the most common way they are prepared on a large nori sheet (nori is a type of edible sea weed) with rice
                and long stripes of vegetables and such. They are then rolled and sliced to multiple pieces, which gives
                them their cylindrical shape.

            <image-card title="Miso Soup (みそ汁)"><p>
                This traditional soup is made using miso, which is an ingredient that consists out of fermented soybeans.
                It often is a part of a typical japanese meal served in a small bowl, and is eaten without a spoon. To eat
                it, you will have to take the bowl close to your mouth and pick out the ingredients and drink the soup.
            </p></image-card>
            <image-card title="Ramen (ラーメン)"><p>
                Ramen is a hot soup with noodles. It is often flavoured using soy sauce and it uses a variety of other
                ingredients like pork, seaweed, tofu, etc. Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen.<br>
                You can eat ramen by first picking out the noodles and ingredients with chopsticks and then drink the soup
                out of the bowl.

            <image-card title="Udon (うどん)"><p>
                Udon are somewhat similar to ramen, but they use another type of noodles. Unlike ramen, they are not filled
                with lots of extra ingredients and kept very simple, as the thick noodles are already very filling.

            <image-card title="Bento (弁当)" id="bento"><p>
                Bento is somewhat similar to a lunchbox, but they have a large variety of different ingredients and take
                a lot of time to make. They are home-made boxes with a single portion of food and a traditional bento usually
                contains rice or noodles, fish or meat and cooked vegetables, but there are all kinds of different bento.<br>
                Of course, not every bento has to be self-made, there is always a large selection of bentos you can buy at
                a supermarket. They are quite convenient when you are traveling and do not have much time.
